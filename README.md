Data Preparation: Cleaned and merged datasets to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Grouping & Aggregation: Used GROUP BY and AVG() to calculate average grades by attendance, motivation, study hours, and learning styles.

Ordering & Comparison: Applied ORDER BY to identify top-performing groups and trends.

- Insights :
Higher attendance generally correlates with better grades, though not the only factor.
